# LoRaWAN Transformer and UI for Java

The repository provides a domain representation of a LoRaWAN device's observations, and the means of transforming LoRaWAN payloads into a normalized object. These normalized objects can then shared with other parts of the system.

Web services are also provided to server up a web based UI, authenticate, receive observation events and receive device meta data events.
